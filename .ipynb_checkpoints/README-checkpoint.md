# Lab | Supervised Learning

## Getting Started

In this lab we will work on two supervised learning problems to predict malicious vs benign websites. We are reducing the instructions in this lab which means you will need to solve a lot of the problems by yourself. Anything new in this lab will be accompanied with detailed instructions. But for the knowledge and techniques you have used before will have brief instructions. Eventually we hope you will be able to think by yourself without instructions

Read the instructions for each cell and provide your answers. Make sure to test your answers in each cell and save. Jupyter Notebook should automatically save your work progress. But it's a good idea to periodically save your work manually just in case.

## Deliverables

- Downloaded notebooks with your responses to each of the exercises.


## Submission

- Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. 
- Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
- Make a pull request and paste the PR link in the submission field in the Student Portal.
